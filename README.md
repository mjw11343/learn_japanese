# 🗾 Gentle Immersion — A Simple Story-Based Way to Learn Japanese Kanji

## ✨ About This Method

This project offers a gentle way to learn Japanese — especially kanji — through simple, repetitive stories that slowly replace familiar English words with Japanese kanji, pronunciation, and literal meanings.

Each story is written mostly in English but uses Japanese word placement where it feels natural. Words are introduced in small, clear steps. New words repeat often in short stories about daily life, animals, greetings, or other familiar topics. By reading these stories, you see the new words in context, hear their sounds, and remember their meaning naturally.

You, the learner, can decide when a word is “learned.” After that, it appears only in kanji with pronunciation hints, and the stories keep using it so you don’t forget.  
This is a slow, calm way to build confidence in reading, speaking, and understanding kanji, step by step.

## 📑 How It Works

### 1️⃣ The Basic Process

1. **Read a Short Story**  
   - Each story focuses on one simple idea, like a morning routine or a small animal’s day.
   - The text repeats the same new words many times in different but clear ways.

2. **Introduce Each New Word in Steps**  
   - For each new word:
     - First 3 times: show the English word, kanji, pronunciation, and literal meaning.
     - After that: show only the kanji with pronunciation.
   - This lets your brain connect the meaning, sound, and written kanji slowly.

3. **Keep Old Words Alive**  
   - Old words appear naturally in future stories, even after you mark them as learned.
   - This builds real reading comfort over time.

4. **Finish with a Recap**  
   - Every story ends with:
     - A clear vocabulary table.
     - A small “Try It” note to practice saying the words aloud.

5. **Mark Words as Learned**  
   - When you feel ready, mark a word as learned.
   - The next stories show only the kanji for that word, with pronunciation if needed.

## 🧰 How to Make Your Own Stories

This project can be used by anyone — or made by you with an AI or by hand. Here is a simple guide:

1️⃣ **Pick a Simple Topic**  
   - Small everyday ideas work best: morning, night, greeting a friend, weather, animals.

2️⃣ **Choose 1–3 Target Words**  
   - Pick common, useful words you want to remember.

3️⃣ **Write a Short Story**  
   - Keep the language clear and repetitive.
   - Use the target words at least 5–10 times.
   - Follow the translation steps for each word.

4️⃣ **Add a Recap**  
   - End with a vocabulary table:
     | English | Kanji | Pronunciation | Literal |
   - Add a simple reminder to say the words out loud.

5️⃣ **Keep Building**  
   - Make a new story next time with a few new words and keep old words active.
   - Mark words as learned when you feel ready.
